1.4: 2020/04/12
* The provided source code (/src directory; MCALT_spm12_segment.m) has new 
functionality to transform atlases to the input image space using ANTs and 
calculate per-region GM/tissue volumes and TIV as .csv files. With these 
additions, this function now re-implements the complete SPM12 T1-weighted 
processing pipeline used in Dr. Jack's Aging and Dementia Research Lab at Mayo 
Clinic. Output volumes are not exactly identical but can be directly compared 
with those computed in-house.
* The MCALT_Lobar atlas has been updated to fill in the posterior "tendrils" of 
the ventricles, to improve the rate at which tissue in this region may be 
captured by the atlas.

1.3: 2018/09/19
This release adds three new files to MCALT: 1) a 0.5mm T1-weighted template 
image; 2) a mask of voxels inside the cranial vault, i.e. the TIV; 3) a 
segmentation mask designed to remove misclassified adjacent regions of 
gray-matter-isointense dura from medial temporal lobe (MTL) segmentations.
* ./MCALT_T1_05mm.nii
A higher-resolution (0.5mm) version of MCALT space. This is not the version on 
which all MCALT atlases were drawn and defined (MCALT_T1.nii). We created this 
version later, intended primarily for visualizations. It is possible to use 
this 0.5mm version for atlas propagation, but this has not been rigorously 
tested. To create this image, the same 202 (~1mm T1-weighted) MRI as in the 
standard MCALT template were coregistered using buildTemplateParallel.sh from 
the ANTs package, using a copy of MCALT_T1.nii up-sampled to 0.5mm as a rigid 
reference target. A single warp (masked to prioritize matching brain voxels) 
was then calculated between the generated 0.5mm template image and the standard 
(1.5mm) MCALT_T1.nii. This final warp improved the voxel-wise correspondence 
between the template versions, thus making it possible to consider this new 
image to be in the same voxel "space" as MCALT, rather than a new and 
incompatible template space. All 202 scans were warped via the transforms 
generated by buildTemplateParallel concatenated with the final warp across 
templates, then averaged, to create the final MCALT_T1_05mm.nii
* ./MCALT_TIVmask.nii
A mask of MCALT voxels that exist inside the cranial vault, i.e. the total 
intracranial volume.
* ./atlas/MCALT_MTL_nogo.nii
MCALT_MTL_nogo is a mask designed primarily to remove misclassified adjacent 
regions of gray-matter-isointense dura from medial temporal lobe (MTL) 
segmentations. It contains non-brain voxels, proximal to the medial temporal 
regions, that SPM12 segmentations can sometimes misclassify as brain despite 
their being labelled as non-brain in our MCALT_tpm. For better segmentation 
accuracy, we recommend that this mask be applied after segmentation to set any 
contained voxels as non-GM and non-WM. We typically apply this mask to improve 
segmentation results in native space. It may also be reasonable to apply this 
mask to segmentations in template space, but we have not tested it for that use.

1.2: 2018/07/21
This release adds:
* A mask of MCALT voxels that contain primarily brain tissue (gray matter or 
white matter).
* Matlab source code to perform SPM12 unified segmentation (tissue-class 
probabilities, bias correction, and normalization to MCALT space) using MCALT 
tissue priors and our modified segmentation method/settings that are optimized 
for older adults age 30+. Regional gray matter volumes measured using this 
segmentation method have larger AUROC values than standard SPM12 pipelines when 
comparing between matched groups of amyloid-positive cognitively-impaired and 
amyloid-negative cognitively-unimpaired subjects. See the source code comments 
and MCALT_Segmentation_Poster.pdf for more information.

1.1: 2017/08/24
This release adds two new atlases defined in MCALT space:
1) MCALT_GlobalPiB, which is used to define amyloid-positivity from amyloid PET 
scans
2) MCALT_pathologyAtlas, which is used for correlation of imaging and 
pathologic findings. This atlas has been previously described in:
