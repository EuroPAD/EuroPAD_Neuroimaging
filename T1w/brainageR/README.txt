## BRAIN AGE computation ##

# this folders contain 2 scripts that allow the computation of brain age from T1w images 

The first script will be the only one to be run: brainage_Europad.sh

brainage_Europad.sh takes as an input the "file_list.txt" , makes few adjustments and then run the do_one_brainage.sh script, that in turn calls the brainageR funtion for that specific file.
