Mayo Clinic resting-state fMRI ROIs and independent component analysis (ICA) based connectivity maps to study macro-scale functional networks

The Mayo Clinic resting-state fMRI ROIs and independent component analysis (ICA) based connectivity maps were constructed and made publicly available for fMRI analyses in aging and Alzheimer’s disease population studies. The first set of ROIs consist in 68 binary masks forming various large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks identified by resting-state fMRI in a sample of healthy older subjects from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) (Jones et al., 2012). The independent component analysis (ICA) based connectivity maps include both a high and low dimensional decomposition. The high dimensional decomposition contains subnetworks of the default mode network (DMN) (anterior dorsal DMN; anterior ventral DMN; ventral DMN; posterior DMN) that can be utilized to compute the Network Failure Quotient (NFQ), a robust connectivity-based biomarker of macro-scale network failure in Alzheimer’s disease (Wiepert et al., 2017).
