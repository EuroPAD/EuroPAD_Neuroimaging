# AMYPAD-PNHS Multimodal MRI Processing

This GIT repository is a collection of scripts used in the (pre-)processing and phenotype-extraction from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images in AMYPAD (Amyloid imaging to prevent Alzheimer's Disease), a consortium in the making. The [AMYPAD-PNHS](https://amypad.eu) in its current form consists of the full [EPAD-LCS](https://ep-ad.org) as well. To request the neuroimaging data, please see [here](https://amypad.eu/data).

The provided scripts and atlases aim to support open-science practices and increase replicability and understanding of the neuroimaging data utilized in the AMYPAD-PNHS.
