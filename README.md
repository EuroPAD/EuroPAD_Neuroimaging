# EuroPAD Multimodal MRI Processing

This GIT repository is a collection of scripts used in the (pre-)processing and phenotype-extraction from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images in EuroPAD (European Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease), a consortium in the making. EuroPAD consists, among other things, of:  
1. EPAD: https://ep-ad.org/
2. EMIF-AD: https://www.emif.eu/emif-ad-2/
3. AMYPAD-PNHS: https://amypad.eu

The provided scripts and atlases aim to support open-science practices and increase replicability and understanding of the neuroimaging data utilized in EuroPAD.
